# Python_Etsy_Analysis
Exploratory analysis of Etsy's current (Apr '22) top performing sellers. Data was pulled from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/polartech/1m-etsy-shops-sales-data 
and analyzed using Excel, Python, and Tableau. Metrics such as total and average units sold, number of ratings and favorites, ability to customize, time in business, and offering of free shipping and various payment methods were reviewed.
